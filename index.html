          Hello! My name’s Troy, I’m a recent graduate of the University of
          Minnesota, and I will be working with Cru this next year doing
          college ministry in Toulouse, France! I will be interning there for
          one year, working to reach students with the Gospel and build them up
          in their faith. Below you’ll find a bit more about what I’m doing,
          who I’m doing it with, and how you can come alongside us!

          My vision for this year of ministry is that as many students as
          possible would hear the Gospel through engaging them in spiritual
          conversations and building up Christian students to be bold,
          spiritual leaders on their campuses. In 2 Corinthians 5 the apostle
          Paul calls us ambassadors for Christ. That is what I have been called
          to do on the college campuses of Toulouse, and I am prayerfully
          anticipating making and training new ambassadors for Jesus.

          This is the team I’m going with to Toulouse - from left to right is
          Gabe, Rachel, myself, and Monica. While being sent by the Great
          Commission looks different for everyone, the four of us have been
          convicted that giving the firstfruits of our post-college lives to
          the Lord through full-time ministry with Cru in Europe is what that
          looks like for us, and we cannot be more thrilled to see how God
          works through this next year!

          Cru is a caring community passionate about connecting people to Jesus
          Christ. It’s a nonprofit organization similar to the Navigators or
          InterVarsity, and has been a source of a lot of growth and
          edification in my faith throughout college. I’ve been involved with
          them for four years, and have led with them for two of those. Many of
          my closest friends are students that I met through Cru, and I am very
          excited to have the opportunity to work with them to provide
          discipleship and community to students over in France who may not
          know anyone who shares their faith!

          I can already see God's hand at work in Toulouse and in this team that
          is being sent. I would love to share with you more about the ministry
          and how you can partner with me prayerfully, financially, and in
          other ways! Feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email!
